                  The 138m jump is the code number indicating the only point for
                  bungee jumping in Crete where you can test your limits facing

                  south Crete, at one of the highest points for bungee jumping
                  in Europe. The tallest bridge for bungee jumping in Greece
                  unites the two edges of the Aradena gorge at the height of
                  138m

                  The gorge of Aradena is located in the region of Sfakia, in
                  the prefecture of Chania, 85 kilometres from the city and same
                  distance from Rethymno. The risky plunge into the void of the
                  steepest and deepest gorge of 138 meters deep is one of the
                  most impressive natural scenery that you have ever visited in
                  the island of Crete. The iron bridge over the vertiginous
                  precipice is the highest bridge for bungee in Greece and the
                  second in Europe. The Aradena Gorge, also known as "Faraggas",
                  is one of the most beautiful and largest of Crete, having a
                  length of 15 meters. If you prefer hiking in the gorge, a
                  quieter gorge than Samaria, Imbros or Agia Irini, take the
                  route starts from the abandoned village of Aradena that runs a
                  deep cut of the southern slopes of the White Mountains and
                  ends to the beach of Marmara (2Â½ to 3 hours of walking time).

                  The gorge of Samaria is situated in the National park of
                  Samaria, in the White Mountains in West Crete. This majestuous
                  gorge is considered one of the great attractions of Crete and
                  many tourists want to visit it. But you must realise that it
                  is a long (5 to 7 hours) walk on rough terrain so you will
                  need to have a certain degree of fitness and walking
                  experience in order to enjoy it.

                  The Samaria National Park has traditionally always opened to
                  the public at the beginning of May. It has often been possible
                  to enter the gorge of Samaria at some point in April from the
                  bottom part but this depends on the weather and the amount of
                  work needed to restore the path after the winter rains. So the
                  opening dates of the gorge vary: it could open a little before
                  the 1st of May, on the 1st of May or later (if the weather is
                  bad or repair work is late).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The gorge of Samaria closes to the public at the end of
                  October. but may close earlier if autumn rains (not uncommon
                  in October) damage the path or make some cliffs unstable. The
                  gorge will also be closed on rainy days (when there is a
                  danger of rock falls). In winter, high water makes the gorge
                  of Samaria dangerous and impassable. The park opens daily at
                  daylight (so the exact time will vary depending on the time of
                  the year) and closes in the evening. If you want to enter the
                  park after around 14.00 you will not be allowed past the first
                  quarter of the walk and will need to return to your starting
                  point.

                  The Melidoni Cave is located about 1 800 metres northwest of
                  the village. It has an extremely interesting history and
                  amazing archaeological findings some of which are exhibited in
                  the Archaeological Museum of Rethymno. â The Melidoni cave is
                  also called "Gerondospilios". It was used for religious
                  ceremonies. During the Minoan Civilization, it was a place of
                  worship for Talos the bronze giant guardian of Crete who
                  protected the island of Crete from enemies. â It is of
                  archaeological and historical interest. In October 1823 370
                  women and children and 30 warriors who hid from Hussein Bey
                  sought refuge in the Melidoni cave. When he found out, the
                  cave was surrounded by his army and he asked Cretan people to
                  surrender. â When they refused to do so, Ottomans started to
                  attack them. Three months later they dropped combustible
                  materials into an opening leading to the cave and set it on
                  fire. Men, women and children lost their lives in the cave in
                  January 1824.

                  In the central room of the cave there is an ossuary containing
                  the bones of the heroes of Melidoni cave. â The arched
                  entrance to the cave is leading to the first chamber of the
                  cave called "Room of Heroes", where we see "Mnemion"
                  (Monument), a complex filled with stalagmites. On the way to
                  "Stavrodromi" (Crossroad) we get into the right chamber. We
                  reach the "Pashley Room" where stalagmites and stalactites
                  create a wonderful complex. â As we keep on walking, the rock
                  formations give the impression of being on another planet. In
                  the "Room of the rocks" through a narrow path we reach the
                  "Chamber of Katavothra" and we turn right to the "Iperoon"
                  (Gallery). â Walking down the cave we reach "Stavrodromi"
                  again and we walk on the left side of the cave which has only
                  one chamber "The Chamber of Curtains", which is adorned with
                  impressive stalactites and stalagmites.

                  70s hippies from around the globe who used to live here and
                  make huts under the palm trees. Due to the sensitivity of
                  nature around Preveli Beach, the area is protected by the

                  Hiking to the Psiloritis on Crete: This walk is actually a
                  heavier hike or mountain walk to the Psiloritis. The
                  Psiloritis is the highest mountain of Crete with a height of
                  2.456 meters. This mountain is also known as the Ida mountain.
                  The Psiloritis is located in central Crete in the province of
                  Rethymnon. Psiloritis is a bit higher than the Lefka Ori
                  mountains in Chania (white mountains). The mountain has snow
                  for approximately 7 months per year.

                  On the top of Psiloritis is a small church built from rocks,
                  with a cross. The name of this church is Timios Stavros, which
                  is also written on some signs to show you the way to the top
                  of the mountain. Every year at the 14th of September the name
                  day of the church Timios Stavros is celebrated. The mountain
                  was used in ancient times for the extraction of gold and
                  copper. Down from the Psiloritis mountain, at the Nida
                  plateau, is the Idaion Antron cave located. In this cave Zeus
                  was born, or was it the cave of Zeus at Lassithi?! According
                  to the legend, Zeus grew up on the top of Psiloritis.

                  Crete Triopetra Rethymno: Triopetra (=three stones) beach owes
                  its name to the three imposing rocks found in its waters. It
                  is located 52 km south of Rethymno town and 13 km north of
                  Akoumia village. The beach of Triopetra is long and sandy. Due
                  to its geographical position, it is frequently affected by
                  southern winds. However, it remains popular due to its crystal
                  waters. There are some accommodation options close to this
                  beach and nice taverns with excellent seafood. Triopetra beach
                  is mostly famous for the wide range of water sports and for
                  its lovely sunset that creates beautiful colors in the sky. To
                  go to Triopetra beach, you have to go to Akoumia village and
                  then take a difficult track. When you are about to reach the
                  beach, you have to continue on foot for about 5 minutes.

                  The Arkadi Monastery is an Eastern Orthodox monastery,
                  situated on a fertile plateau 23 km (14 mi) to the southeast
                  of Rethymnon . The current catholicon (church) dates back to
                  the 16th century and is marked by the influence of the
                  Renaissance. This influence is visible in the architecture,
                  which mixes both Roman and baroque elements. As early as the
                  16th century, the monastery was a place for science and art
                  and had a school and a rich library. Situated on a plateau,
                  the monastery is well fortified, being surrounded by a thick
                  and high wall. The monastery played an active role in the
                  Cretan resistance of Ottoman rule during the Cretan revolt of
                  1866. 943 Greeks, mostly women and children,[1] sought refuge
                  in the monastery. After three days of battle and under orders
                  from the hegumen (abbot) of the monastery, the Cretans blew up
                  barrels of gunpowder, choosing to sacrifice themselves rather
                  than surrender. The monastery became a national sanctuary in
                  honor of the Cretan resistance. 8 November is a day of
                  commemorative parties in Arkadi and Rethymno. The explosion
                  did not end the Cretan insurrection, but it attracted the
                  attention of the rest of the world.

                  he Venetian Loggia in Rethymno Crete: The Loggia of Rethymno
                  is a 16th-century Venetian building situated right in the
                  center of the Old Town of Rethymno. It is a wonderful square
                  building with three visible walls, each provided with three
                  equal semicircular arches. The middle arch provides an
                  entrance at the ground level. The southern side of this
                  elegant structure has no opening. The Loggia of Rethymno used
                  to be the meeting place of the noble people of the town to
                  discuss economic and political issues. It also acted as a
                  hosting place for many business and entertainment activities
                  of the Venetians. The Loggia was built according to the plans
                  of the well-known Veronese engineer Michele Sanmicheli. There
                  are two statues with human faces on the west wall. In the year
                  1625, an upper storey was added to the main building. It was
                  converted into a mosque after the fall of Rethymnon to the
                  Turks. A turret was built on the west side of the mosque, but
                  it was pulled down in the 1930s. The Loggia is a few yards
                  away from the Venetian harbor, directly opposite to it. There
                  is a narrow passage near the center of the Venetian harbor
                  that leads to this elegant Venetian structure. At present,
                  Loggia belongs to the Ministry of Culture and hosts the
                  Archaeological Museum of Rethymno.

                  The Municipal Gallery âL.Kanakakisâ was founded in 1992. From
                  its beginning, the Municipal Gallery was housed in a Venetian
                  building in the center of the old, historical town of
                  Rethymnon, below the Fortezza and the Archaeological Museum.
                  Its permanent collection includes works of Lefteris Kanakakis
                  (oil paintings, drafts, and aquarelles) thus representing all
                  the stages of his achievements and works of contemporary Greek
                  artists, thus covering a wide spectrum of modern Greek art as
                  it has been accomplished from 1950 until today. In 1995, the
                  town of Rethymnon was incorporated into the National Cultural
                  Network and, as a result, the Centre for Contemporary Art.
                  Since 2002 functions within the framework of Visual Art
                  Network â The domain of culture. The Rethymnon Centre for
                  Contemporary Art is initiating dynamic activities in the field
                  of periodic exhibitions of local, national, and international
                  interest in co-operation with many agencies in Greece and
                  abroad. All events are accompanied by lectures, training
                  programs, speeches, seminars, etc. The exhibition activities
                  of the Rethymnon Centre for Contemporary Art-Municipal Gallery
                  âL.Kanakakisâ will be concluded with the issue of catalogs and
                  other printed material of educational and informative nature.
                  At the same time, visual art workshops, have been operating
                  under the auspices of the R.C.A. since 1995.
