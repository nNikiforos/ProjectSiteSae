            The long history of Rethymno is traced back to the Neolithic years
            where a plethora of archaeological findings including coins, signs,
            and writings of ancient historians witness the inhabitance of
            fishermen in Gerani Cave. During the Minoan period, Rethymno and the
            rest of Cretan cities flourished greatly on an economical and
            cultural level. From the 12th to the 11th century BC, the Minoan
            civilization developed rapidly in trade and culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many towns were constructed that period in Crete. The most important
            Minoan town in Rethymno was Ancient Eleftherna . However, the
            catastrophic erection of Santorini volcano marked the end of this
            prosperous period. The following years, the beautiful cities of
            Crete including Rethymno are conquered by the Dorians, Romans,
            Venetians, Turks, and Germans and the brave Cretans are unable to
            maintain their independence.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1204, a new period started for Crete and particularly Rethymno.
            With the abolition of the Byzantine Empire, the island surrendered
            to the Venetians. However, due to their many conquests in
            Peloponissos and Aegean, Venetians neglected their new accession
            gave access to the other conquers of Crete. The presence of the
            legendary pirate Barbarossa in the city in 1538 was quite important
            for Rethymno. His attack led to the construction of extensive
            fortifications for the protection of Rethymno.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flourishing period of Rethymno begun in the early 16th century
            highlighting the history of the city, a unique blend of Cretan and
            Venetian culture. The city was almost entirely rebuilt by the
            Venetians. This led to the Cretan Renaissance, a gold period of arts
            and letters that is apparent only in Crete and the Ionian islands.
            Rethymno flourishes rapidly with the arrival of new scientists and
            intellectuals. Many literary societies and a
            <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/35.3663471,24.5599013/rethymno+public+library/@35.3646659,24.4675221,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m1!4e1!1m5!1m1!1s0x149b75af89d347e9:0x37ed07fe5d303926!2m2!1d24.4670466!2d35.3653551" target="_blank">public library</a>
            were established in Rethymno. Unfortunately, this cultural era ends
            in 1669 when Turks conquered Crete leading to the decline of
            Rethymno. The locals of Rethymno continued their fight against the
            Turks which led to many casualties. Finally, in 1897 Crete gained
            its independence and in 1913 it was united with the
            newly-established Greek state.
          </p>
          <p>
            This town is even more historically significant, as it played an
            important role in World War II.
            <br />
            During the Battle of Crete in 1941, the Battle of Rethymno was
            fought between German paratroopers and the Hellenic Army. Although
            the Hellenic Army defended the town bravely during the first part of
            the battle, it ultimately fell to Germany when they received
            reinforcements from the village of Maleme, Crete.
